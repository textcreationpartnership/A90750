            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ſetting forth of the publick Confeſſion of the Faith of Churches hath a double end, and both tending to publick edification. Firſt the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Faith entire within it ſelf: Secondly, the holding forth of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Harmony, both amongſt our ſelves, and with other Churches. Our Churches here (as by the Grace of Chriſt) we beleeve and profeſs the ſame Doctrine of the Truth of the Goſpel, which generally is received in all the reformed Churches of Chriſt in</hi> Europe: <hi>ſo eſpecially, we deſire not to vary from the Doctrine of Faith and Truth held forth by the Churches of our Native Country. For though it be not one Native Country that can breed us all of one mind, nor ought we for to have the glorious Faith of our Lord Jeſus with reſpect of perſons; yet as</hi> Paul, <hi>who was himſelf a Jew, profeſſed to hold forth the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith, and of the reſurrection of the dead, according as he knew his godly Country-men did, who were Jews by Nature</hi> (Galat. 2.15. Acts 26.6, 7.) <hi>ſo we, who are by Nature Engliſh-men, do deſire to hold forth the ſame Doctrine of Religion (eſpecially in Fundamentals) which we ſee and know to be held by the Churches of</hi> England, <hi>according to the Truth of the Gospel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The more we diſcern (that which we do, and have cauſe to do with inceſſant mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and trembling) the unkind, and unbrotherly, and unchriſtian contentions of our godly Brethren and Country-men in matters of Church-Government; the more earneſtly do we deſire to ſee them joyned together in one common Faith, and our ſelves with them. For this end, having peruſed the publick confeſſion of Faith, agreed upon by the Reverend Aſſembly of Divines at</hi> Weſtminſter, <hi>and finding the Sum and Subſtance thereof (in matters of Doctrine) to expreſs not their own Judgments only, but ours alſo: and being likewiſe called upon by our Godly Magiſtrates, to draw up a publick confeſſion of that Faith which is conſtantly taught, and generally profeſſed amongſt us, we thought good to preſent unto them, and with them to our Churches, and with them to all the Churches of Chriſt abroad, our profeſſed and hearty aſſent and atteſtation to the whol confeſſion of Faith (for ſubſtance of Doctrine) which the Reverend Aſſembly preſented to the Religious and Honorable Parliament of</hi> England: <hi>Excepting only ſome Sections in the</hi> 25.30. <hi>and</hi> 31. <hi>Chapters of their Confeſſion, which concern Points of Controverſie in Church-Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline; Touching which we refer our ſelves to the draught of Church-Diſcipline in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing Treatiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:118330:5"/>
            <p>
               <hi>The truth of what we here declare, may appear by the unanimous vote of the Synod of the Elders and Meſſengers of our Churches aſſembled at</hi> Cambridg; <hi>the laſt of the ſixth Month,</hi> 1648. <hi>which joyntly paſſed in theſe words;</hi> This Synod having peruſed, and conſidered (with much gladneſs of heart, and thankfulneſs to God) the confeſſion of Faith publiſhed of late by the Reverend Aſſembly in <hi>England,</hi> do judg it to be very holy, orthodox, and judicious in all matters of Faith; and do therefore freely and fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thereunto, for the ſubſtance thereof. Only in thoſe things which have reſpect to Church-Government and Diſcipline, we refer our ſelves to the Platform of Church-Diſcipline agreed upon by this preſent Aſſembly: and do therefore think it meet, that this confeſſion of faith, ſhould be commended to the Churches of Chriſt amongſt us, and to the Honored Court, as worthy of their due Conſideration and Acceptance. <hi>Howbeit, we may not conceal, that the Doctrine of Vocation expreſſed in</hi> Chap, 10. Sect. 1. <hi>and ſummarily repeated,</hi> Chap. 13. <hi>and</hi> 1. <hi>paſſed not without ſome debate. Yet conſidering, that the term of Vocation, and others by which it is deſcribed, are capable of a large, or more ſtrict ſenſe, and uſe, and that it is not intended to bind apprehenſions preciſely in point of Order or Method, there hath been a general condeſcendency thereunto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now by this our profeſſed conſent, and free concurrence with them in all the Doctrinals of Religion, we hope it may appear to the world, that as we are a remnant of the People of the ſame Nation with them; ſo we are Profeſſors of the ſame common Faith, and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Heirs of the ſame common Salvation. Yea moreover, as this our Profeſſion of the ſame faith with them, will exempt us (even in their judgments) from ſuſpicion of Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; ſo (we truſt) it may exempt us in like ſort from ſuspicion of Schiſm; that though we are forced to deſſent from them in matters of Church-Diſcipline, yet our diſſent is not taken up out of arrogancy of spirit in our ſelves (whom they ſee willingly condeſcend to learn of them:) neither is it carried with uncharitable cenſoriouſneſs towards them (both which are the proper, and eſſential Characters of Schiſem) but in meekneſs of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as we walk along with them, and follow them, as they follow Chriſt: ſo where we conceive a different apprehenſion of the mind of Chriſt (as it falleth out in ſome few points touching Church-order) we ſtill reſerve due reverence to them (whom we judg to be, through Chriſt, the glorious Lights of both Nations:) and only crave leave (as in spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit we are bound) to follow the Lamb whither ſoever be goeth, and (after the Apoſtles example) as we beleeve, ſo we ſpeak.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And if the example of ſuch poor outcaſts as our ſelves, might prevail if not with all (for that were too great a bleſſing to hope for) yet with ſome or other of our Brethren in</hi> England, <hi>ſo far as they are come to mind and ſpeak the ſame thing with ſuch as diſſent from them, we hope in Chriſt, it would not only moderate the harſh judging and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of one another in ſuch differences of judgment as may be found in the choyceſt Saints</hi> 3 <hi>but alſo prevent (by the mercy of Chriſt) the peril of the diſtraction and diſtruction of all the Churches in both Kingdoms: Otherwiſe, if Brethren ſhall go on to bite and devour one another, the Apoſtle fears (as we alſo with ſadneſs of heart do) it will tend to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming of them, and us all; which the Lord prevent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We are not ignorant, that (beſides theſe asperſions of Hereſie and Schiſm) other excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alſo are taken at our way of Church-Government: but (as we conceive) upon as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ground.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:118330:5"/>
            <p>As 1. That by admitting none into the fellowſhip of our Church, but Saints by cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, we rob many Pariſh-Churches of their beſt Members, to make up one of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations: which is not only, to gather Churches out of Churches (a thing not heard of in Scripture) but alſo to weaken the hearts and hands of the beſt Miniſters in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, by diſpoyling them of their beſt Hearers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we provide no courſe for the gaining, and calling in of ignorant, and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious and ſcandalous perſons, whom we refuſe to receive into our Churches, and ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from the wholſom remedy of Church-Diſcipline.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That in our way, we ſow ſeeds of diviſion, and hindrance of edification in every Family: whilſt admitting into our Churches only Voluntaries, the Husband will be of one Church, the Wife of another; the Parents of one Church, the Children of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the Maſter of one Church, the Servants of another: and ſo the Parents and Maſters being of different Churches from their Children and Servants, they cannot take a juſt account of their profiting by what they hear, yea, by this means the Husbands, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and Maſters, ſhall be chargable to the maintenance of many other Churches and Church-Officers beſides their own; which will prove a charge and burden unſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But for Anſwer; as to the firſt: For gathering Churches out of Churches, we cannot ſay, that it is a thing unheard of in Scripture. The firſt Chriſtian Church was gathered out of the Jewiſh Church, and out of many Synagogues in that Church, and conſiſted partly of the Inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>partly of the</hi> Galileans; <hi>who though they kept ſome commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in ſome parts of publick Worſhip with the Temple: yet neither did they frequent the Sacrifices, nor repair to the Sanedrim for the determining of their Church-cauſes; but kept entire and conſtant communion with the Apoſtles Church in al the Ordinances of the Gospel. And for the firſt Chriſtian Church of the Gentiles at</hi> Antioch, <hi>it appeareth to have been gathered and conſtituted, partly of the disperſed Brethren of the Church at</hi> Jeruſalem (<hi>whereof ſome were men of</hi> Cyprus <hi>and</hi> Cyren) <hi>and partly of the beleeving Gentiles,</hi> Acts, 11.20, 21.</p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, the firſt Chriſtian Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that at <hi>Antioch,</hi> were gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red not out of any Chriſtian Church, but out of the Jewiſh Temple, and Synagogues, which were ſhortly after to be aboliſhed; and their gathering to <hi>Antioch,</hi> was upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of diſperſion in time of Perſecution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We deſire it may be conſidered,</hi> 1. <hi>That the Members of the Jewiſh Church were more ſtrongly and ſtraitly tyed by expreſs holy Covenant, to keep fellowſhip with the Jewiſh Church till it was aboliſhed, than any Members of Chriſtian Pariſh-churches are wont to be tied to keep fellowſhip with their Pariſh-churches. The Epiſcopal Canons, which bind them to attend on their Pariſh Church, it is likely they are now aboliſhed with the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy. The common Law of the Land is ſatisfied (as we conceive) if they attend upon the Worſhip of God in any other Church though not within their own Pariſh. But no ſuch like Covenant of God, nor any other Religious Tye lieth upon them to attend the Worſhip of God in their own Pariſh Church, as did lie upon the Jews to attend upon the Worſhip of God in their Temple and Synagogues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Though the Jewiſh Temple Church at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>was to be aboliſhed, yet that doth not make the deſertion of it by the Members to be Lawful, till it was aboliſhed. Future abolition is no warrant for preſent deſertion; unleſs it be Lawful in ſome caſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:118330:6"/>whilſt the Church is yet in preſent ſtanding to deſert it; to wit, either for avoiding of preſent polutions, or for hope of greater edification, and ſo for better ſatisfaction to conſcience in either future events (or foreſight of them) do not deſolve preſent relation: Elſe Wives, Children, Servants, might deſert their Husbands, Parents, Maſters when they be mortally ſick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>What the Members of the Jewiſh Church did, in joyning to the Church at</hi> Antioch, <hi>in time of perſecution, it may well be conceived, the Members of any Chriſtian Church may do the like for ſatisfaction of conſcience. Peace of conſcience is more deſirable, than the peace of the outward Man: and freedom from ſcruples of conſcience is more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to a ſincere heart, than freedom from perſecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be ſaid, theſe Members of the Chriſtian Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that joyned to the Church at <hi>Antioch,</hi> removed their habitations together with their Relations: which if the Brethren of the Congregational way would do, it would much abate the grievance of their departure from their Presbyterial Churches.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We verily could wiſh them ſo to do, as well approving the like removal of Habitations, in caſe of changing Church-Relations (provided, that it may be done without too much detriment to their outward eſtate) and we for our parts have done the ſame. But to put a neceſſity of removal of Habitation in ſuch a caſe, it is to foment and cheriſh a corrupt principle of making Civil Cohabitation, if not a formal cauſe, yet at leaſt a proper Adjunct of Church-Relation, which the Truth of the Gospel doth not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg. Now to foment an Error to the prejudice of the Truth of the Gospel, is not to walk with a right foot according to the Truth of the Gospel, as</hi> Paul <hi>judgeth.</hi> Galat. 2.14.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>We do not think it meet, or ſafe, for a Member of a Presbyterial Church, forthwith to deſert his relation to his Church, betake himſelf to the Fellowſhip of a Congregational Church, though he may diſcern ſome defect in the Eſtate, or Government of his own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For firſt, Faithfulneſs of Brotherly Love in Church-Relation, requireth, that the Members of the Church ſhould firſt convince their Brethren of their ſinful defects, and duly wait for their reformation, before they depart from them. For if we muſt take ſuch a courſe for the healing of a private Brother, in a way of Brotherly Love, with much meekneſs and patience: how much more ought we ſo to walk with like tenderneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a whol Church.</p>
            <p>Again ſecondly, By the haſty departure of ſound Members from a defective Church, Reformation is not promoted, but many times retarded, and corruption increaſed. Whereas on the contrary, while ſincere Members breathing after purity of Reformation abide together, they may (by the bleſſing of God upon their faithful endeavors) pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail much with their Elders and Neighbors towards a Reformation; it may be, ſo much, as that their Elders in their own Church ſhall receive none to the Lords Table, but vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Saints: and in the Claſſis ſhall put forth no Authoritive Act (but Conſultative only) touching the Members of other Churches: nor touching their own, but with the conſent (ſilent conſent at leaſt) of their own Church: which two things, if they can obtain with any humble, meek, holy, faithful endeavors, we conceive, they might (by the grace of Chriſt) find liberty of conſcience to continue their Relation with their own Presbyterial Church without ſcruple.</p>
            <pb n="5" facs="tcp:118330:6"/>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>But to ad a word further, touching the gathering of Churches out of Churches; What if there were no expreſs example of ſuch a thing extant in the Scriptures? that which we are wont to anſwer the</hi> Antipaedobaptiſts, <hi>may ſuffice here: it is enough, if any evidence thereof may be gathered from juſt conſequence of Scripture-Light. Doctor</hi> Ames <hi>his Judgment concerning this caſe, paſſeth (for ought we know) without excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he gave in his fourth Book of Conſcience in Anſwer to</hi> 2. <hi>Queſt. C.</hi> 14. <hi>Num.</hi> 16. If any <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> wronged with unjuſt vexation, or providing for his own edification, or in teſtimony againſt ſin, depart from a Church where ſome evils are tolerated, and joyn himſelf to another more pure, yet without condemning of the Church he leaveth, he is not therefore to be held as a Schiſmatick, or as guilty of any other ſin. <hi>Where the Tripartite disjunction which the judicious Doctor putteth, declareth the Lawfulneſs of the departure of a Church-Member from his Church, when either through wearineſs of unjuſt vexation, or in way of proviſion for his own edification, or in teſtimony againſt ſin, he joyneth himſelf to another Congregation more Reformed. Any one of theſe he judgeth a juſt and lawful cauſe of departure, though all of them do not concur together. Neither will ſuch a practice dispoil the beſt Miniſters of the Pariſhes of their beſt Hearers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For 1. Sometimes the Miniſters themſelves are willing to joyn with their better ſort of Hearers, in this way of Reformation: and then they and their Hearers continue ſtill their Church-Relation together, yea, and confirm it more ſtraitly and ſtrongly, by an expreſs renewed Covenant; though the Miniſters may ſtil continue their wonted prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching to the whol Pariſh.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the Miniſters do diſlike the way of thoſe, whom they otherwiſe count their beſt Members, and ſo refuſe to joyn with them therein; yet if thoſe Members can procure ſome other Miniſter to joyn with them in their own way, and ſtill continue their dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling together in the ſame Town, they may eaſily order the times of the publick Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, as to attend conſtantly upon the Miniſtry of their former Church: and either after or before the publick Aſſembly of the Pariſh take an opportunity to gather toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the adminiſtration of Sacraments and Cenſures, and other Church-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances amongſt themſelves. The firſt Apoſtolick Church aſſembled to hear the Word with the Jewiſh Church in the open Courts of the Temple; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards gathered together for breaking of Bread, and other Acts of Church-Order from houſe to houſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Suppoſe, Presbyterial Churches ſhould communicate ſome of their beſt gifted Members towards the erecting and gathering of another Church: it would not forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with be their detriment, but may be their inlargement. It is the moſt noble and perfect work of a living Creature (both in Nature and Grace) to propagate and multiply his Kind: and it is the honor of the faithful Spouſe of Chriſt, to ſet forward the Work of Chriſt as well abroad as at home. The Church in <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.8. to help forward her little ſiſter Church, was willing to part with her choyce materials, even beams of Cedar, and ſuch precious living ſtones as were fit to build a ſilver Pallace. In the ſame Book, the Church is compared ſometime to a Garden, ſometime to an Orchard, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.12, 13. No man Planteth a Garden, or Orchard, but ſeeketh to get the choyſeſt Herbs and Plants of his Neighbors, and they freely impart them; nor do they account it a ſpoyl to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:118330:7"/>their Gardens and Orchards, but rather a glory. Nevertheleſs we go not ſo far: we neither ſeek, nor ask the choyce Members of the Pariſhes, but accept them being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If it be ſaid, they are not offered by the Miniſters, nor by the Pariſh Churches (who have moſt right in them) but only by themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It may juſtly be demanded, what Right, or what Power have either the Miniſters, or Pariſh-Church over them? Not by ſolemn Church-Covenant: for that, though it be the firmeſt engagement, is not owned, but rejected. If it be by their joyning with the Pariſh, in the calling and election of a Miniſter to ſuch a Congregation at his firſt coming, there is indeed juſt weight in ſuch an Engagement: nor do we judg it ſafe for ſuch to remove from ſuch a Miniſter, unleſs it be upon ſuch grounds, as may juſtly give him due ſatisfaction. But if the union of ſuch Members to a Pariſh Church, and to the Miniſtry thereof, be only by cohabitation within the Precincts of the Pariſh, that union, as it was founded upon humane Law, ſo by humane Law it may eaſily be releaſed. Or otherwiſe, if a man remove his Habitation, he removeth alſo the bond of his relation, and the ground of offence.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It need not to be feared, that all the beſt Hearers of the beſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, no nor the moſt of them, will depart from them upon point of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thoſe who have found the preſence and Power of the Spirit of Chriſt brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in their Miniſters, either to their converſion, or edification, will be ſlow to change ſuch a Miniſtry of Faith, and Holineſs, for the liberty of Church-Order. Upon which ground, and ſundry other ſuch like, there be doubtleſs ſundry godly and judicious Hearers in many Pariſhes in <hi>England</hi> that do and will prefer their Relation to their Miniſters (though in a Presbyterial way) above the Congregational Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foederation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But if all, or the moſt part of the beſt Hearers of the beſt Miniſters of Pariſhes, ſhould depart from them, as preferring in their judgments, the Congregational way: yet, in caſe the Congregational way ſhould prove to be of Chriſt, it will never grieve the holy hearts of godly Miniſters, that their Hearers ſhould follow after Chriſt: yea, many of themſelves (upon due deliberation) will be ready to go along with them. It never grieved nor troubled <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, that his beſt Diſciples departed from him to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 3. But in caſe the Congregational way ſhould prove to be not the inſtitution of Chriſt (as we take it) but the invention of men: then doubtleſs, the Presbyterial Form (if it be of God) will ſwallow up the other, as <hi>Moſes</hi> rod devoured the rods of the Aegyptians. Nor will this put a neceſſity upon both the oppoſite parties to ſhift for themſelves, and to ſeek to ſupplant one another: but only it wil call upon them <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

               </gap> to ſeek and to follow the Truth in Love, to attend in faithfulneſs each unto his own Flock, and to adminiſter to them all the holy things of God, and their portion of food in due ſeaſon: and as for others, quietly to ſorbear them, &amp; yet to inſtruct them with meekneſs that are contrary minded: leaving it to Chriſt (in the uſe of al good means) to reveal his own Truth in his own time: and mean while endeavoring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. <hi>Philippians,</hi> chap. 3. verſe 15, and 16. <hi>Epheſians,</hi> 4.3.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond Exception, That we take no courſe for the gaining and healing
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:118330:7"/>and calling in of ignorant, and erronious and ſcandalous perſons, whom we refuſe to receive into our Churches, and ſo exclude them from the remedy of Church-diſcipline.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We conceive the receiving of them into our Churches would rather looſe and corrupt our Churches, than gain and heale them. A little Leaven layed in a lump of dough, will ſooner leaven the whole lump, than the whole lump will ſweeten it. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore find it ſafer, to ſquare rough and unhewen ſtones, before they be laid into the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding rather than to hammer and hew them, when they lie unevenly in the building.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And accordingly, two meanes we uſe to gain and call in ſuch as are ignorant or ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous.</hi> 1. <hi>The publick Miniſtry of the word, Upon which they are invited by counſel, and required by wholſom Laws to attend. And the word it is, which is the power of God to ſalvation, to the calling and winning of ſoules.</hi> 2. <hi>Private conference, and conviction by the Elders, and other able brethren of the Church: whom they do the more reſpectively hearken unto, when they ſee no hope of enjoying Church fellowſhip, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation in the Sacraments for themſelves, or their Children, till they approve their judgments to be ſound and orthodox, and their lives ſubdued to ſome hope of a godly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. What can Claſſical diſcipline, or excommunication it ſelf do more in this caſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 3. Exception wrappeth up in it a three-fold domeſtical inconvenience, and each of them meet to be eſchewed. 1. Diſunion in Families between each relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: 2. Diſappointment of edification, for want of opportunity in the Governors of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies to take account of things heard by their children and ſervants.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Disburſments of chargable maintenance to the ſeveral Churches, whereto the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons of their Families are joyned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All which inconveniences either do not fall out in Congregational Churches; or are eaſily redreſſed. For none are ſo orderly admitted into Congregational Churches, but ſuch as are well approved by good teſtimony; to be duly obſervant of Family relations. Or if any otherwiſe diſpoſed ſhould creep in, they are either orderly healed, or duely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved in a way of Chriſt: Nor are they admitted, unleſs they can give ſome good account of their profiting by Ordinances before the Elders and Brethren of the Church: and much more to their Parents and Maſters. Godly Tutors in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity can take an account of their Pupils; and Godly Houſholders in the City, can take account of their Children and Servants, how they profit by the Word they have heard in ſeveral Churches; and that to the greater edification of the whol Family, by the variety of ſuch adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Bees may bring the more Honey, and Wax into the Hive, when they are not limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to one Garden of Flowers, but may fly abroad to many.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nor is any charge expected from Wives, Children, or Servants to the maintenance of Congregational Churches, further than they be furniſhed with Perſonal eſtates, or Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, which may enable them to contribute of ſuch things as they have, and not of ſuch as they have not. God accepteth not Robbery for a Sacrifice. And though a godly Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder may juſtly take himſelf bound in conſcience, to contribute to any ſuch Church, whereto his Wife, or Children, or Servants do ſtand in relation: yet that will not aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the burden of his charge, no more than if they were received Members of the ſame Church whereto himſelf is related.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But why do we ſtand thus long to plead exemptions from exceptions? The Lord help all his faithful Servants (whether Presbyterial, or Congregational) to judg and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118330:8"/>ſhame our ſelves before the Lord for all our former complyances to greater enormities in Church-Government, than are to be found either in the Congregational, or Presbyterial Way. And then ſurely, either the Lord will cleer up his own Will to us, and ſo frame, and ſubdue us all to one mind, and one will</hi> (Ezek. 43.10.11.) <hi>or elſe we ſhall learn to bear one anothers burdens in a ſpirit of meekneſs. It will then doubtleſs be far from us, ſo to atteſt the Diſcipline of Chriſt, as to deteſt the Diſciples of Chriſt: ſo to contend for the ſeamleſs coat of Chriſt, as to crucifie the living Members of Chriſt: ſo to divide our ſelves about Church-communion, as through breaches to open a wide gap for a deluge of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian and prophane malignity to ſwallow up both Church and Civil State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>What ſhall we ſay more? is difference about Church-Order become the inlet of all the diſorders in the Kingdom? hath the Lord indeed left us to ſuch hardneſs of heart, that Church-Government ſhall become a ſnare to</hi> Zion (<hi>as ſometimes</hi> Moſes <hi>was to</hi> Egypt, Exod. 10.7.) <hi>that we cannot leave conteſting and contending about it, till the Kindom be deſtroyed? did not the Lord Jeſus, when he dedicated his ſufferings for his Church, and his Church alſo unto his Father, make it his earneſt and only Prayer for us in this world, that we all might be one in him?</hi> John, 17.20, 21, 22, 23. <hi>And is it poſſible, that He (whom the Father heard alwaies,</hi> John, 11.42.) <hi>ſhould not have this laſt moſt ſolemn Prayer heard, and granted? or, ſhall it be granted for all the Saints elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and not for the Saints in</hi> England? <hi>ſo that amongſt them diſunion ſhall grow even about Church-union, and communion? If it be poſſible for a little faith (ſo much as a grain of Muſtard-ſeed) to remove a mountain: is it not poſſible, for ſo much ſtrength of faith, as is to be found in all the the godly in the Kingdom, to remove thoſe Images of jealouſie, and to caſt thoſe ſtumbling blocks out of the way, which may hinder the free paſſage of brotherly love amongſt Brethren? It is true indeed, the National Covenant doth juſtly ingage both Parties, faithfully to endeavor the utter extirpation of the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Hierarchy, and much more of all Blaſphemies, Hereſies, and damnable Errors. Certainly, if Congregational Diſcipline be Independant from the inventions of men, is it not much more independant from the deluſions of Satan? what fellowſhip hath Chriſt with Belial? Light with Darkneſs? Truth with Error? The faithful Jews needed not the help of the Samaritans, to Re-edifie the Temple of God; yea, they rejected their help when it was offered,</hi> Ezra 4.1, 2, 3. <hi>And if the Congregational way be a way of Truth (as we beleeve) and if the Brethren that walk in it be zealous of the Truth, and hate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very falſe way (as by the Rule of their holy Diſcipline they are inſtructed,</hi> 2 John, 10.11.) <hi>then verily, there is no branch in the National Covenant, that ingageth the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanters to abhor either Congregational Churches, or their way: which being duly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, do no leſs effectually extirpate the Antichriſtian Hierarchy, and all Blaſphemies, Hereſies, and pernitious Errors, than other way of Diſcipline doth, which is more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and publickly received and ratified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the Lord Jeſus commune with our hearts in ſecret: and he who is the King of his Church, let him be pleaſed to exerciſe his Kingly Power in our Spirits, that ſo his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom may come into our Churches in Purity and Peace.</hi> Amen, Amen.</p>

<note place="margin">Acts 9.26.</note> There is like reaſon for trying of them that profeſs themſelves to be Beleevers.</p>
            <p>The Officers are charged with the keeping of the doors of the Church,

<note place="margin">Matth. 3.6.</note> as may ſatisfie <hi>rational charity</hi> that the things are there indeed. <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt admitted men to Baptiſm, confeſſing and bewailing their ſins: and of others it is ſaid, that they came,
<note place="margin">Acts 19.18.</note> and confeſſed, and ſhewed their deeds.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The weakeſt <hi>meaſure</hi> of Faith is to be accepted in thoſe that deſire to be admitted into the Church:
<note place="margin">Rom. 14.1.</note> becauſe weak Chriſtians if <hi>ſincere</hi> have the <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of that faith, repentance and holineſs which is required in Church-Members: and ſuch have moſt <hi>need</hi> of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances for their confirmation and growth in grace.

            <p n="4">4.

            <p n="7">7. The like tryal is to be required from ſuch Members of the Church, as were born in the ſame, or received their Memberſhip, and were baptized in their infancy or minority, by vertue of the Covenant of their Parents, when being grown up unto years of diſcretion, they ſhall deſire to be made partakers of the Lords Supper: unto which, becauſe Holy things muſt not be given unto the unworthy,
<note place="margin">Matth. 7.6. 1 Cor. 11.27.</note> therefore it is requiſite, that theſe as well as others, ſhould come to their tryal and examination, and manifeſt their Faith and Repentance by an open profeſſion thereof, before they are received to the Lords Supper, and otherwiſe not to be admitted thereunto.</p>

<note place="margin">Jude 29, Deut: 13, 11 1 Cor: 5, 6 Rom: 2, 24</note> for the reclaiming and gaining of offending brethen: for the deterring of others from the like offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: for purging out the leaven which may infect the whole lump: for vindicating the honor of Chriſt, and of his Church,
<note place="margin">Rev: 2, 14 15, 16, &amp; 20</note> &amp; the holy profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Goſpel: and for preventing of the wrath of God, that may juſtly fall upon the Church, if they ſhould ſuffer his covenant, and the ſeales therof, to be prophaned by notorious and obſtinate offenders.</p>
            <p n="2">2.
<note place="margin">Mat: 5, 23, 24 Luk: 17 3, 4</note> If an offence be <hi>private</hi> (one brother offending another) the offender is to goe, &amp; acknowledg his repentance for it unto his offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed brother, who is then to forgive him, but if the offender neglect or refuſe to do it, the brother offended is to goe,
<note place="margin">Mat: 18, 15</note> &amp;convince &amp; admoniſh him of it, between themſelves privatly: if therupon the offender be brought to repent of his offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, the admoniſher hath won his brother, but if the offender hear not his brother,
<note place="margin">Verſe 16</note> the brother offended is to take with him one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, every word may be eſtabliſhed, (whether the word of admonition if the offender receive it, or the word of complaint if he refuſe it:)
<note place="margin">Verſe 17.</note> for if he refuſe it, the offended brother is by the mouth of the Elders to tel the Church; and if he hear the Church, and declare the ſame by penite<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t confeſſion, he is recovered and gayned; and if the Church diſcern him to be willing to hear, yet not fully convinced of his offence,
<note place="margin">Tit: 3, 10</note> as in caſe of hereſy, they are to diſpence to him a publick admonition; which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the offender to ly under the publick offence of the Church, doth therby with-hold or ſuſpend him from the holy fellowſhip of the Lords ſupper, till his offence be removed by penitent confeſſion.
<note place="margin">Mat: 18, 17</note> If he ſtill continue obſtinate they are to caſt him out by excommunication.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But if the offence be more <hi>publick</hi> at firſt,
<note place="margin">1 Cor: 5, 4, 5 &amp; verſe 18.</note> and of a more <hi>heynous</hi> and <hi>criminal nature,</hi> to wit, ſuch as are condened by the light of nature; then the Church without ſuch graduall proceeding, is to caſt out the offender, from their holy communion, for the further mortifying of his ſinn and the healing of his ſoule, in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In dealing with an offender, great care is to be taken, that wee be neither overſtrict or rigorous, nor too indulgent or remiſs:
<note place="margin">Galat: 6, 1</note> our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding herein ought to be with a ſpirit of meekneſs, conſidering our ſelves leſt wee alſo be tempted;
<note place="margin">Mat: 18, 34 23, c 6, 14.35, Ezek: 13, 10: Jer: 6, 14</note> &amp; that the beſt of us have need of much forgivnes from the Lord. Yet the wining &amp; healing of the offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ders ſoul, being the end of theſe endeavors, wee muſt not daub with untempered morter, nor heal the wounds of our brethren ſlightly. On ſome have compaſſion, others ſave with fear.</p>
            <pb n="22" facs="tcp:118330:19"/>
            <p n="5">5.
<note place="margin">Mat, 18, 17 1 Cor, 5, 11 2 Theſ, 3, 6 14</note> While the offender remains excommunicate, the Church is to <hi>refrarn from all member-like communion</hi> with him in ſpirituall things, and alſo from al familiar co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with him in civil things, farther then the neceſſity of natural, or domeſtical, or civil relations do require: and are therfore to forbear to eat &amp; drink with him, that he may be <hi>aſhamed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Excommunication being a ſpirituall puniſhment, it doth not prejudice the excommunicat in, nor deprive him of his <hi>civil rights,</hi> and therfore toucheth not Princes, or other Magiſtrates, in point of their civil dignity or auothority.
<note place="margin">1 Cor, 14, 24, 25</note> And, the excommunicate being but as a publican and a heathen, heathens being lawfully permitted to come to hear the word in Church aſſemblyes;
<note place="margin">2 Theſ, 3, 14</note> wee acknowledg therfore the like liberty of hearing the word, may be permitted to perſons excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, that is permitted unto heathen. And becauſe wee are not without hope of his recovery, wee are not to account him as an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but to admoniſh him as a brother.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If the Lord ſanctifie the cenſure to the offender, ſo as by the grace of Chriſt,
<note place="margin">2 Cor, 2, 7, 8</note> he doth teſtifie his repentance, with humble confeſſion of his ſin, and judging of himſelf, giving glory unto God; the Church is then to <hi>forgive</hi> him, and to <hi>comfort</hi> him, and to <hi>reſtore</hi> him to the wonted brotherly communion, which formerly he injoyed with them.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The ſuffering of prophane or ſcandalous Livers to continue in fellowſhip,
<note place="margin">Rev, 2, 14, 15, verſ, 20</note> and partake in the Sacrament, is doubtleſs a great ſin in thoſe that have power in their hands to redreſs it, and do it not. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs,
<note place="margin">Mat, 23, 3 Acts 3, 1</note> in as much as Chriſt and his Apoſtles in their times, and the Prophets and other godly in theirs, did lawfully partake of the Lords commanded Ordinances in the Jewiſh Church, and neither taught nor practiſed <hi>ſeparation</hi> from the ſame, though unworthy ones were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted therin; and inaſmuch as the faithfull in the Church of Corinth, wherin were many unworthy perſons,
<note place="margin">2 Cor, 6 chap 15, 12</note> and practiſes, are never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to abſent themſelves from the Sacraments, becauſe of the ſame: therfore the godly in like caſes, <hi>are not preſently</hi> to <hi>ſeparate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. As <hi>ſeparation</hi> from ſuch a Church wherin profane and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Livers are tolerated, is not preſently neceſſary: ſo for the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers therof, otherwiſe worthy, hereupon to <hi>abſtain</hi> from communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating with ſuch a Church,
<note place="margin">2 Chron, 30 18, Gen, 18, 25</note> in the participation of the Sacraments, is unlawfull. For as it were unreaſonable for an innocent perſon to be puniſhed, for the faults of others wherin he hath no hand, and wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto he gave no conſent: ſo is it more unreaſonable, that a godly
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:118330:19"/>man ſhould neglect duty, and puniſh himſelf in not coming for his portion, in the bleſſing of the ſeals, as he ought, becauſe others are ſuffered to come, that ought not, eſpecially conſidering that himſelf doth neither conſent to their ſin, nor to their approaching to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance in their ſin,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 9.10.</note> nor to the neglect of others who ſhould put them away, and do not: but on the contrary doth heartily mourn for theſe things, modeſtly and ſeaſonably ſtir up others to do their duty. If the Church <hi>cannot be refermed,</hi> they may uſe their liberty as is ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, chap. 13. Sect. 4.

Rom. 16.16 1 Cor 16.19 Acts 15.23 Rev. 2.1.</note> and therefore may not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded one with another: and equal, and therefore have not dominion one over another: yet all the Churches ought to preſerve <hi>Church-communion</hi> one with another, becauſe they are all united unto Chriſt, not only as a Myſtical, but as a Political Head; whence is derived <hi>a communion</hi> ſuitable thereunto.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>communion</hi> of Churches is exerciſed ſundry ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1.
<note place="margin">Cant. 8.8.</note> By way of mutual <hi>care</hi> in taking thought for one anothers welfare.</p>
            <p n="2">II. By way of <hi>conſultation</hi> one with another, when we have occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to require the judgment and counſel of other Churches, touching any perſon, or cauſe wherewith they may be better acquainted than our ſelves. As the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> conſulted with the Apoſtles and Elders of the Church at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 15, 2</note> about the queſtion of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of the Gentils, and about the falſe Teachers that broached that Doctrin. In which caſe,
<note place="margin">Acts 15, 6,</note> when any Church wanteth light or peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelvs, it is a way of communion of Churches (according to the Word) to meet together by their Elders and other Meſſengers in a Synod, to conſider &amp; argue the points in doubt, or difference,
<note place="margin">Verſ 22, 23</note> and having found out he way of truth and peace, to commend the ſame by their Letters and Meſſengers to the Churches, whom the ſame may concern.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:118330:20"/>
            <p>But if a church be rent with diviſions amongſt themſelves, or lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any open ſcandal, &amp; yet refuſe to conſult with other Churches, for healing or removing of the ſame; it is a matter of juſt offence both to the Lord Jeſus, and to other Churches, as bewraying too much want of mercy and faithfulneſs,
<note place="margin">Ezck. 34.4.</note> not to ſeek to bind up the breaches and wounds of the Church and Brethren; and therefore the ſtate of ſuch a Church calleth aloud upon other Churches, to exerciſe a fuller act of brotherly communion, to wit, by way of <hi>Admonition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. A third way then of communion of Churches is by way of <hi>admonition,</hi> to wit, In caſe any publick offence be found in a Church, which they either diſcern not,
<note place="margin">Gal. 2.11. to 14.</note> or are ſlow in proceeding to uſe the means for the removing and healing of. <hi>Paul</hi> had no authority over <hi>Peter,</hi> yet when he ſaw <hi>Peter</hi> not walking with a right foot, he publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rebuked him before the Church: though Churches have no more authority one over another, than one Apoſtle had over another; yet as one Apoſtle might admoniſh another, ſo may one Church admoniſh another, and yet without uſurpation. In which caſe, if the Church that lyeth under offence,
<note place="margin">Mat. 18.15, 16, 17. by proportion.</note> do not hearken to the Church which doth admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh her, the Church is to acquaint other neighbor-churches with that offence, which the offending Church ſtill lieth under, together with their neglect of the brotherly admonition given unto them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon thoſe other Churches are to joyn in ſeconding the admonition formerly given: and if ſtil the offending Church continue in obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and impenitency, they may forbear co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>munion with them; and are to proceed to make uſe of the help of a Synod, or counſel of neighbor churches walking orderly (if a greater cannot conveniently be had) for their conviction. If they hear not the Synod, the Synod having declared them to be obſtinate, particular Churches approving and accepting of the judgment of the Synod, are to declare the ſentence of non-communion reſpectively concerning them: and thereupon out of a religious care to keep their own communion pure, they may juſtly withdraw themſelves from participation with them at the Lords Table, and from ſuch other Acts of Holy communion, as the communion of Churches doth otherwiſe allow and require. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, if any Members of ſuch a Church as lieth under publick of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, do not conſent to the offence of the Church, but do in due ſort bear witnels againſt it,
<note place="margin">Gen. 18.25.</note> they are ſtil to be received to wonted communion: for it is not equal, that the innocent ſhould ſuffer with the offenſive.</p>
            <pb n="25" facs="tcp:118330:20"/>
            <p>Yea furthermore; if ſuch innocent Members after due waiting in the uſe of all good means for the healing of the offence of their own Church, ſhal at laſt (with the allowance of the counſel of neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor Churches) withdraw from the fellowſhip of their own Church, and offer themſelves to the fellowſhip of another; we judg it law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for the other Church to receive them (being otherwiſe fit) as if they had been orderly diſmiſſed to them from their own Church.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. A fourth way of communion of Churches, is by way of <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation:</hi> the Members of one Church occaſionally coming unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, we willingly admit them to <hi>partake</hi> with us at the Lords Table, it being the ſeal of our communion not only with Chriſt, nor only with the Members of our own Church,
<note place="margin">1 Cor 12.13</note> but alſo with all the Churches of the Saints; in which regard, we refuſe not to baptize their children preſented to us, if either their own Miniſter be abſent, or ſuch a fruit of holy fellowſhip be deſired with us. In like caſe ſuch Churches as are furniſhed with more Miniſters than one, do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly afford one of their own Miniſters to ſupply the place of an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent or ſick Miniſter of another Church for a needful ſeaſon.</p>
            <p n="5">V. A fifth way of Church-communion is,
<note place="margin">Rom. 16.3.</note> by way of <hi>Recommendation</hi> when a Member of one Church hath occaſion to reſide in another Church; if but for a ſeaſon we commend him to their watchful fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip by letters of recommendation: but if he be called to ſettle his abode there, we commit him according to his deſire,
<note place="margin">Acts 18.27.</note> to the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of their Covenant, by letters of diſmiſſion.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. A ſixt way of Church-communion, is in caſe of <hi>Need,</hi> to Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>relief and ſuccor</hi> one unto another:
<note place="margin">Acts 11.22.</note> either of able Members to furniſh them with Officers;
<note place="margin">verſ. 29. Rom. 13.26 27.</note> or of outward ſupport to the neceſſities of poorer Churches; as did the Churches of the Gentiles contribute liberally to the poor Saints at Jeruſalem.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When a company of Beleevers purpoſe to gather into Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fellowſhip, it is requiſite for their ſafer proceeding, &amp; the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the communion of Churches,
<note place="margin">Gal. 2.1, 2. and 9. by proportion.</note> that they ſignifie their intent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the neighbor Churches, walking according unto the order of the Goſpel, and deſire their preſence, and help, and right hand of fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which they ought readily to give unto them, when there is no juſt cauſe of excepting againſt their proceedings.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Beſides theſe ſeveral waies of communion, there is alſo a way of propagation of Churches; when a Church ſhal grow too nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118330:21"/>it is a way,
<note place="margin">Iſay 40.20. Cant: 8, 8, 9</note> &amp; fit ſeaſon, to propogate one Church out of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, by ſending forth ſuch of their me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers as are willing to remove, and to procure ſome Officers to them, as may enter with them into Church-eſtate a mongſt themſelves: as Bees, when the hive is too ful, iſſue forth by ſwarms, and are gathered into other hives, ſo the Churches of Chriſt may do the ſame upon like neceſſity; and therin hold forth to them the right hand of fellowſhip, both in their gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into a Church; and in the ordination of their Officers.</p>

            <p n="4">4. It belongeth unto Synods and Counſels, to debate and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min controverſies of faith,
<note place="margin">Acts 17.1.2.6.7. 1 Chron. 15 23.</note> and caſes of conſcience; to clear from the Word holy directions for the holy Worſhip of God, &amp; good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, to bear witneſs againſt miſ-adminiſtration and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:118330:21"/>Corruption in doctrine or maners in any particular Church,
<note place="margin">2 Chron. 29.6, 7 Acts 15, 24. verſ 28, 29</note> &amp; to give directions for the reformation therof: Not to exerciſe Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſures in way of diſcipline, nor any other act of church authority or juriſdiction: which that preſidentiall Synod did forbeare.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Synods directions and determinations, ſo farr as conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the word of God, are to be received with reverence &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; not only for their agreement therwith (which is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ground therof, and without which they bind not at all:) but alſo ſecondarily, for the power wherby they are made,
<note place="margin">Acts 15</note> as being an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God appointed therunto in his word.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Becauſe it is difficult, if not impoſſible, for many churches to com al together in one place, in al their members univerſaly: therfore they may aſſemble by their delegates or meſſengers, as the church of Antioch went not all to Jeruſalem,
<note place="margin">Acts 15, 2</note> but ſome ſelect men for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. Becauſe none are or ſhould be more fit to know the ſtate of the churches, nor to adviſe of wayes for the good thereof than Elders; therfore it is fit that in the choyce of the meſſengers for ſuch aſſemblies, they have ſpecial reſpect unto ſuch.
<note place="margin">Acts 15, 2. verſ, 22, 23;</note> Yet in as much as not only Paul &amp; Barnabas, but certayn others alſo were ſent to Ieruſalem from Antioch. Acts 15. and when they were come to Jeruſalem, not only the Apoſtles &amp; Elders, but other brethren alſo doe aſſemble, &amp; meet about the matter; therfore Synods are to conſiſt both of Elders, &amp; other church-members, endued with gifts, &amp; ſent by the churches, not excluding the preſence of any brethren in the churches.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XVII. <hi>Of the Civil Magiſtrates power in matters Eccleſiaſtical.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IT is lawfull, profitable, And neceſſary for Chriſtians to gather themſelves into Church eſtate, and therin to exerciſe all the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinanaces of Chriſt accoridng unto the word,
<note place="margin">Acts 2 41, 47 c 4, 1, 2, 3,</note> although conſent of the Magiſtrate could not be had therunto; becauſe the Apoſtles &amp; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in their time did frequently thus practiſe, when the Magiſtrates being all of them Jewiſh or pagan, and moſtly perſecuting enemies, would give no countenance or conſent to ſuch matters.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Church-government ſtands in no oppoſition to civil government of common-wealths,
<note place="margin">John 18, 36</note> nor any way intrencheth upon the authority of
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:118330:22"/>Civil Magiſtrates in their juriſdictions;
<note place="margin">John 18.36 Acts 25.8.</note> nor any whit weakneth their hands in governing, but rather ſtrengthneth them, and furthereth the people in yielding more hearty &amp; conſcionable obedience unto them, whatſoever ſome ill affected perſons to the wayes of Chriſt have ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, to alienate the affections of Kings and Princes form the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Chriſt, as if the Kingdom of Chriſt in his church could not riſe &amp; ſtand, without the falling &amp; weakning of their government, which is alſo of Chriſt:
<note place="margin">Iſay. 49.23.</note> wheras the contrary is moſt true, that they may both ſtand together and flouriſh the one being helpfull unto the other, in their diſtinct and due adminiſtrations.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The power and authority of Magiſtrates is not for the reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of churches,
<note place="margin">Rom. 13.4. 1 Tim. 2.2.</note> or any other good workes, but for helping in &amp; fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering therof; &amp; therfore the conſent &amp; countenance of Magiſtrates when it may be had, is not to be ſlighted, or lightly eſteemed; but on the contrary; it is part of that honour due to chriſtian Magiſtrates to deſire &amp; crave their conſent &amp; approbation therin: which being obtayned, the churches may then proceed in their way with much more encouragement, and comfort.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is not in the power of Magiſtrates to compell their ſubjects to become church-members, and to partake at the Lords table; for the prieſts are reproved,
<note place="margin">Ezek. 44.7.9. 1 Cor. 5.11.</note> that brought u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>worthy ones into the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie: then, as it was unlawful for the preiſts, ſo it is as unlawful to be done by civil Magiſtrates. Thoſe whom the church is to caſt out if they were in, the Magiſtrate ought not to thruſt into the church, nor to hold them therin.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As it is unlawfull for church-officers to meddle with the ſword of the Magiſtrate,
<note place="margin">Matth. 20.25.26.</note> ſo is it u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>lawfull for the Magiſtrate to meddle with the work proper to church officers: the Acts of Moſes &amp; David, who were not only Princes,
<note place="margin">2 Chron. 26 16, 17.</note> but Prophets, were extraordnary; therfore not imitable. Againſt ſuch uſurpation the Lord witneſſed, by ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Uzziah with leproſie, for preſuming to offer incenſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is the duty of the Magiſtrate, to take care of matters of religion, and to improve his civil authority for the obſerving of the duties commanded in the firſt,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 82.2.</note> as well as for obſerving of the duties commanded in the ſecond table. They are called Gods. The end of the Magiſtrates office,
<note place="margin">1 Tim. 2.1.2.</note> is not only the quiet &amp; peaceable life of the ſubject, in matters of righteouſneſs and honeſty, but alſo in matters of godlineſs, yea of all godlineſs. Moſes, Joſhua, David, Solomon,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118330:22"/>Aſa, Jehoſhaphat Hezekiah, Joſiah,
<note place="margin">1 Kings 15.14. c. 22.43 2 King. 12.3 c. 14.4. c 15 35. 1 Kings 20.42. Job 29.25. c. 31 26.28. Neh. 14. Jonah 3 7. Ezra 7. Dan. 3.29.</note> are much commended by the Holy Ghoſt for the putting forth their authority in matters of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: on the contrary, ſuch Kings as have been fayling this way, are frequently taxed &amp; reproved by the Lord. And not only the Kings of judah, but alſo Job, Nehemiah, the King of Niniveh, Darius, Artaxerxes, Nebucadnezar, whom none looked at as types of Chriſt, (though were it ſo, there were no place for any juſt objection,) are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mended in the book of God, for exerciſing their authority this way</p>
            <p n="7">7 The object of the power of the Magiſtrate, are not things meerly inward, and ſo not ſubject to his cogniſance &amp; view, as unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leif, hardneſs of heart, erronious opinions not vented; but only ſuch things as are acted by the outward man; neither is their power to be exerciſed, in commanding ſuch acts of the outward man,
<note place="margin">1 Kings 20.28. verſ. 11</note> and puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the neglect therof, as are but meer inventions, &amp; devices of men; but about ſuch acts, as are commanded &amp; forbidden in the word; yea ſuch as the word doth clearly determine, though not alwayes clearly to the judgment of the Magiſtrate or others, yet clearly in it ſlfe. In theſe he of right ought to putt forth his authority,
<note place="margin">Deut. 13. 1 Kings 20.28. verſ. 42 Dan. 3.29. Zach. 13.3. Neh. 13.21 1 Tim. 2.2. Rom. 13.4.</note> though oft-times actually he doth it not.</p>
            <p n="8">8 Idolatry, Blaſphemy, Hereſy, venting corrupt and pernicious opinions, that deſtroy the foundation, open contempt of the word preached, prophanation of the Lords day, diſturbing the peaceable adminiſtration &amp; exerciſe of the worſhip &amp; holy things of God, and the like, are to be reſtrayned, and puniſhed by civil authority.</p>
            <p n="9">9 If any church, one or more ſhall grow ſchiſmaticall, rending it ſelf from the communion of other churches, or ſhall walke incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigibly or obſtinately in any corrupt way of their own, contrary to the rule of the word; in ſuch caſe, the Magiſtrate is to put forth his coercive power, as the matter ſhall require.
